Hi Scott, I just want to clarify what I should do right now. We have fit the backward PDE of u(t, s) about option price, so I am going to apply the same algorithm to the forward PDE of S which is the Fokker-Planck equation and the initial condition is characterized by the delta function. The goal, as I understand it, is to fit a function that takes a stock price S and a time point t, and returns the probability density p(S, t) at that point. The initial condition is defined by a Dirac delta function centered at some fixed initial stock price S0. Should I set the initial price fixed for now to see if it works?
