Hi Robert, thanks again for the chat! I’ll revise the definition of dimensionality to make sure there’s no confusion between PDE dimensionality and neural network input dimensionality. I’ll also clean up the structure of the slides a bit—especially the math part—to make the derivation clearer and easier to follow.
