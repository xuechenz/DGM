Sure, I will implement the BSDE method for SABR model once I tried forward PDE. I want to define the loss function as PDE redidual where the points was sampled from the lognormal distribution across the time steps, loss for initial points by delta function (approximated with Gaussian distribution), boundary loss where S = 0 and S_max the density should be 0, and integration loss where the integration from 0 to S_max should near 1.
