Hi Scott, I have tried NLL loss. I used Monter Carlo to simulate the forward path and simulated for the density at each time steps and used NLL loss to optimize the MDN. The result plot does not perform as good as the reference point method. I guess directly comparing with the density approximated by the Monter Carlo approximation is still our current best choice.
