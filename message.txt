I'm not sure if DGM can handle the forward PDE, because the PDE residual now depends on its derivatives: dp/dt - [ (sigma^2 - r) * p + (2 * sigma^2 * S - r * S) * dp/dS + 0.5 * sigma^2 * S^2 * d2p/dS2 ]. I am not sure if I am doing the forward PDE residual correctly. Should I first try a fixed S0 as an input?
