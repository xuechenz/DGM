Hi Scott, Iâ€™ve done some fine-tuning of the parameters, and the training time is now around 15 minutes. The fitted Fokker-Planck solution for SABR is much more stable, and compared to the Monte Carlo method, it yields a much smoother surface. While there are still some differences, I believe the accuracy can be further improved with more detailed tuning. Currently, the model takes all SABR parameters as inputs except for nu, but we can incorporate nu in the same way as the others if needed. Below is the resulting output:
