Yes, I actually tried calculating the covariance as part of the output for SABR and increased the number of Gaussians to 20, but it still didn't converge well. I can try increasing the number of output Gaussians further, but that would require a more complex network—both deeper and with a larger hidden dimension—to handle something like 300 outputs. I can use residual connection in inner layers to deal with the vanishing gradient problem.
