Hi Scott! Huge progress! I did not use the new paper method, instead, I realized that we could convert the Geometric Brownian Motion of S to Arithmetic Brownian Motion by taking log(S/S0) as the input to factor out the S from the SDE. This would allows us convert the domain of S from (0, S_Max) to (-inf, inf), which renders extra flexibility to our neural net. Also, since I realized that we need to anchor the general shape of our PDF, so for the inner point sampling, I sampled 0.7 along the monte carlo path and 0.3 specifically uniformly sampled from the main area (0, T) * (S_Max - S_Min), so in the later time steps, we still have enough points to anchor the general shape. The whole design of loss function and net was maintain the same as the DGM paper. Here is the convergence at each time steps with the log-normal analytical solution.
