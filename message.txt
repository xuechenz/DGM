Hi Robert, I’ll revise the definition of dimensionality to make sure there’s no confusion between PDE dimensionality and neural network input dimensionality. I’ll also clean up the structure of the slides a bit—especially the math part—to make the derivation clearer and easier to follow. Really appreciate all your guidance these days—it’s been super helpful. I’ve learned a lot from our discussions—thanks so much for your patience and support!
