Hi Robert,

Hope you're having a great weekend. Please find attached the project materials:

The three reference papers

A summary write-up outlining the key methods, challenges, and decisions

Cleaned-up notebooks for:
  • Deep BSDE (Black-Scholes & SABR)
  • DGM (Black-Scholes & SABR)
  • MDN (Fokker-Planck under Black-Scholes)

Paper4_DGMForward: a recent paper related to SABR density modeling

The summary provides context on how the approaches evolved and the reasoning behind model design choices. The code has been reorganized and annotated for clarity.

Quick update on the SABR MDN component: modeling the joint density appears to be quite challenging due to the need to predict a full covariance matrix. I found an alternative approach from a new paper (attached as Paper4_DGMForward) that uses a DGM-style network to approximate the CDF and derive the PDF via numerical differentiation. It appears more stable in principle, and I plan to explore whether this direction might be viable for the SABR case.

Next week, I plan to schedule a few walkthroughs to fine-tune the presentation based on feedback.

Thanks again for all your guidance!

Best regards,
Annie
