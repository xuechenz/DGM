I have constructed the MDN network, and it performs much better than DGM. DGM during training is highly unstable, and some of the time it will not find the correct direction of the gradient to optimize the function. MDN has much stable performance in terms of IC Loss. Both of the network can learn the general shape of the forward PDE of BS model, but they did not captrue the trend over time as you can see from the time sliced comparison. I suspect the reason is that the current model solely depends on the PDE to calculate the inner density, where PDE loss for forward Equation does not contain the model output itself, instead it only use the outputs' 1st and 2nd derivatives. We might need to add another term to directly compare the inner density part from the model to a benchmark. I have found this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10696 online, it provides a new loss function. Besides the PDE loss, they used monte carlo sampling method to sample all data points once, outside of training and once forever, use it as the anchor points density calculate the loss directly with the output from the model, especially the inner density area. Another idea in my mind was using time-series Neural Net, like LSTM, to see if it can capture the trend over time. Do you think it is a worthwhile direction?
