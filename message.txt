Subject: Thank You & Slide Deck Follow-Up

Hi [Boss's Name],

Thank you so much for your time and valuable feedback just now — both on the presentation content and your career advice. I really appreciate it.

Attached is my current version of the slide deck. I’ll continue revising it based on your suggestions to better present the project.

Thanks again!
Best regards,
Annie
