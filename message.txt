I have constructed the chain MDN network, and I used 3 hidden layers for each MDN. I trained each network one by one, and the next MDN net would initialize with the parameters from the previously trained MDN network. All the MDN network was trained solely depends on the REF loss, and now it converge closely with the analytical solution. I was thinking maybe we could ensemble these small networks to a large network to fill in the gap between each time steps by PDE loss to get the entire solution space.
