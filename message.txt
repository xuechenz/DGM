Hi Scott, I have completed the experiment with inputting risk-free rate r as an input. For the reference point generation, I used r from 0 to 0.05, 0.01 as the step size. After training, I extrapolate the fitted function for 0.015 as input, which does not exist in the training data space, but the model still show high convergence to the analytical solution. I will input the rest of the rest of the paramters into the training for the next steps.
