Hi Robert, sorry for the delay in sending the materials.
My work laptop ran into a BitLocker recovery issue yesterday afternoon, and I couldn’t log in or reach IT before end of day.
I just got access back after unlocking it twice through phone support.
I’ve sent the summary, code, and all reference papers to your email.
The issue still isn’t fully resolved, I have to call for recovery key IT support in order to every time log in. IT couldn’t fix it remotely and suggested I go in on Monday to get it replaced.
