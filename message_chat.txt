Hi Robert, so sorry for the delay in sending the materials.
My work laptop ran into a BitLocker recovery issue since yesterday afternoon, and I couldn’t log in or find IT before end of day.

I just got access back through phone support. But the issue still isn’t fully resolved — I have to call for a recovery key each time to log in. IT couldn’t fix it and suggested I go in on Monday to get it replaced.

I’ve sent the summary, code, and all reference papers to your email. The package is the current version as of Week 4, and I’ll follow up with a complete version once everything is finalized.

I’ve also included a brief update on the SABR MDN component in the email — some recent findings that might lead to a more stable approach. Will share more once I’ve tested it further. Apologies for the weekend message, hope you’re having a relaxing weekend!
