I’ve sent the summary, code, and all reference papers to your email. The package is the current version as of Week 4, and I’ll follow up with a complete version once everything is finalized.

I’ve also included a brief update on the SABR MDN component in the email — some recent findings that might lead to a more stable approach. Will share more once I’ve tested it further.
