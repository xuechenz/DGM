Introduction & Background
• Traditional PDE methods struggle with high-dimensional option pricing problems.
• Neural networks offer mesh-free, flexible alternatives for complex financial models.
• Focus: Three deep learning approaches for option pricing and density estimation.
Method 1: Deep BSDE
• Black-Scholes: Forward simulation combined with backward optimization to fit Delta, resulting in the initial option price function u(S) at t=0.
• SABR: Neural networks fit partial derivatives du/dF and du/dα along forward simulated paths, optimizing the backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) residual to determine the initial price.
• Key Advantage: Learns backward from known terminal payoffs.
Method 2: Deep Galerkin Method (DGM)
• Core Concept: A mesh-free method directly approximating PDE solutions at randomly sampled points.
• Black-Scholes: Utilizes a 5-dimensional neural network u(t,S,r,σ,K), eliminating the need for grid discretization.
• SABR: Implements a universal 7-dimensional pricing network u(t,F,α,K,β,ν,ρ) covering broad parameter ranges.
• Key Advantage: Efficiently handles high-dimensional spaces, avoiding the curse of dimensionality.
Method 3: Forward Equation (MDN)
• Purpose: Solves the Fokker-Planck PDE to model the evolution of probability densities.
• Implementation: Employs time-sliced Mixture Density Networks (MDNs), each corresponding to a discrete time slice t_i.
• Process: Takes asset price SS as input, outputs a Gaussian mixture model to approximate the empirical density p(t_i,S).
• Training: Uses Monte Carlo-generated reference densities and minimizes Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Results & Conclusion
• All three methods effectively approximate solutions to complex option pricing problems.
• Each method is suited to distinct scenarios:
Deep BSDE: backward optimization from known terminal payoffs.
DGM: direct PDE solving in high-dimensional settings.
MDN: precise density estimation through probabilistic modeling.
• Deep learning approaches provide powerful, flexible alternatives to traditional numerical methods in financial modeling.
